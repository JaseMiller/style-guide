      horizontal:

          Right align labels and float them to the left to make them appear on
          the same line as controls.

            * Add `.form-horizontal` to the form
            * Wrap labels and controls in `.control-group`
            * Add `.control-label` to the label
            * Wrap any associated controls in `.controls` for proper alignment

          controls for a compact layout.

          Add `.form-search` to the form and `.search-query`

          and all paragraphs. In addition, `<p>` (paragraphs)
